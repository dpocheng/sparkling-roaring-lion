From Ian:
After looking at how we were handling background process reaping, I found that we were doing it wrong
and that no reaping actually took place. Load the version of shellex.c and csapp.c that Dennis
committed on 4/22/15 @ 10:55AM called with the comment "Add csapp.c". Then compile and run the shell.
Now enter any non-built-in command (like test.c that I committed with this) without the & argument.
The process will finish, and after waiting for a few seconds to assure the child process that the
command was running finishes press control-z to send the SIGTSTP command and stop (but not kill) the shell
process. Now enter the ps command. There will be the shell running-- all is well. Enter kill <pid> to kill
the command. Now run the shell again, but run the same command with the & argument to run the process in
the background. Wait a few seconds for the process to finish, and then press control-z again. Now enter
ps to see the processes. You will see that there is a child process that is a zombie which should be
denoted by <defunct> (on my Mac it was in parenthesis instead). The code we had up to this commit doesn't
reap background processes correctly.
